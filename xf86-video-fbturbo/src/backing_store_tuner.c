/*
 * This code implements a heuristics, which enables backing store for some
 * windows. When backing store is enabled for a window, the window gets a
 * backing pixmap (via automatic redirection provided by composite extension).
 * It acts a bit similar to ShadowFB, but for individual windows.
 *
 * The advantage of backing store is that we can avoid "expose event -> redraw"
 * animated trail in the exposed area when dragging another window on top of it.
 * Dragging windows becomes much smoother and faster.
 *
 * But the disadvantage of backing store is the same as for ShadowFB. That's a
 * loss of precious RAM, extra buffer copy when somebody tries to update window
 * content, potentially skip of some frames on fast animation (they just do
 * not reach screen). Also hardware accelerated scrolling does not currently
 * work for the windows with backing store enabled.
 *
 * We try to make the best use of backing store by enabling backing store for
 * all the windows that are direct children of root, except the one which has
 * keyboard focus (either directly or via one of its children). In practice this
 * heuristics seems to provide nearly perfect results:
 *  1) dragging windows is fast and smooth.
 *  2) the top level window with the keyboard focus (typically the application
 *     that a user is working with) is G2D accelerated and does not suffer from
 *     any intermediate buffer copy overhead.
